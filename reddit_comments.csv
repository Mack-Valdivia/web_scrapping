1n5n1rf,nbtsxgp,"This is next-level corruption. Howard Lutnick, the current Commerce Secretary, is a key figure in pushing for these tariffs. At the same time, his sons who are now running his old company, Cantor Fitzgerald, are creating a financial product to profit from the tariffs.

The scheme works like this:
1.  Small businesses get hit with massive tariffs that they can't afford to wait years to get back through the courts.

2.  Cantor Fitzgerald offers to buy their right to a future refund for a small percentage of the value (around 20-30 cents on the dollar).

3.  If a court overturns the tariffs, Cantor Fitzgerald gets the full refund from the government, making a huge profit.

Essentially, the Lutnicks are profiting from a policy that their family is directly involved in creating, while simultaneously taking advantage of the financial desperation it causes for other businesses. It's a textbook case of profiting from the public trust. The father creates the chaos with tariffs, and the sons swoop in to feast on the wreckage, paying pennies on the dollar for what the government owes. It's a ghoulish, predatory strategy where they profit from both the policy and the ruin it creates for everyone else.

This is what happens when you elect people without an iota of integrity to office. And nothing is going to change until lawmakers have business interests. It's a vicious cycle.

Edit: I received a DM from a MAGA supporter saying that tariffs are necessary to recover revenue from Obama's ""secret trade deals"". I'm not sure how I even respond to that.",19743,1756730236.0,politics,0.9672

1n5yfan,nbw8lan,"As of January 2024, Guyana has an estimated 11 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, which is 75% of Brazil's reserves. The International Energy Agency predicts that Guyana's daily production could increase fivefold by 2030, from 250,000 barrels in 2022. 

Venezuela has engaged in military build-ups near its border with Guyana, including troop and equipment movements, in a show of force and preparations for potential military conflict over the disputed Essequibo region. While Guyana's government has responded with diplomatic efforts and sought international legal assistance to de-escalate the situation, the two nations have shown they are prepared for conflict, even though no act of aggression has occurred. 

ExxonMobil and its partners have committed nearly $55 billion to the development of six oil projects in Guyana's offshore Stabroek Block, with over $33 billion of this amount having been spent by early 2025. The investments are primarily for exploring and developing the block's substantial oil reserves, with production from the six projects expected to reach over a million barrels of oil per day by 2027. 

Venezuela's Ministry of Defense states it has between 95,000 to 150,000 active combatants in the Venezuelan Armed Forces (FANB), which also includes the National Guard, Navy, and Air Force, alongside a growing National Militia of hundreds of thousands. 

Guyana's military, the Guyana Defence Force (GDF), has approximately 3,400 active-duty personnel, with an additional 670 in the volunteer reserve. 

Venezuela holds the largest proven oil reserves in the world, with approximately 303-304 billion barrels.",665,1756756877.0,worldnews,0.5423

1n5xbq5,nbvwwj6,"* In 2023, over 6,000 teachers in Oklahoma left the classroom in the 2022-23 school year, representing nearly 14% of the total teaching workforce.
* The state issued a record-setting 4,676 emergency certifications in 2023-24, which allow individuals with a bachelor's degree but no formal teaching qualifications to teach in classrooms. 
* Oklahoma's teacher shortage, according to stats from 2023, is 1,019.

Oklahoma is ranked 50th in education, with a teacher shortage out the wazoo, and Ryan Walters, the fascist, wants to literally do everything counterintuitive to helping our classrooms stay staffed.

  
We're having to hire teachers from Mexico to come in and teach, and Ryan Walters is cancelling meetings and trying to scare off all the teachers with his hate regime.

  
At what point does Oklahoma finally say enough is enough and have Walters deposed from office? It needs to be now.
